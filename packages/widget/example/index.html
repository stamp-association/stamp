          <p>The Permaweb is a web3 ecosystem built on Arweave, a decentralized permanent storage system. The Permaweb
            provides content creators with tools and platforms to store and share content. With the use of SmartWeave
            Contracts, content can be associated with programmable rules that allow dynamic functionality like the
            ability to document attention and the ability to trade. These features can be built into the asset contract
            and can execute without the dependency on a third party or marketplace. As a content creator, you can create
            a standalone blog post with <a href="https://pages.arweave.dev">Permapages</a> or upload a meme with <a
              href="https://img.arweave.dev">IMG</a> and enable visitors to STAMP your work to prove their attention.
            The Permaweb community can use the <a href="https://now.arweave.dev">Now Dashboard</a> to discover what
            content is new and what is trending content and STAMP the content.</p>
          <h2 id="nowarweavedev">now.arweave.dev</h2>
          <div class="flex justify-center">

            <p><img src="https://arweave.net/nI1z6LcUcyg9EvDA4g6Pl7yFoRMxO2eBNGSGn47x-YU" alt="Now Screenshot"></p>
          </div>

          <p><a href="https://now.arweave.dev">Now</a> is the home page for the Permaweb; Now shows what content has
            been getting love in the last 24 hours, seven days, or thirty days. The community can control the
            dashboard&#39;s content by STAMPing their favorite content. The <a href="https://now.arweave.dev">Now</a>
            Dashboard is also a tradeable marketplace; content owners can choose to sell some or all of their content to
            anyone that has <a href="https://bar.arweave.dev">$bar</a>. </p>
          <h2 id="stamp-coin-rewards">STAMP Coin rewards</h2>
          <p>For a limited time, the Stamp Protocol distributes 1000 coin rewards to content owners in a 24-hour cycle.
            Using <a href="https://now.arweave.dev">Now</a>, content creators can &quot;SELL&quot; all or some of their
            content to the community. The Permaweb community can not only show their appreciation for the content, but
            they can also purchase a percent of the content. As others STAMP the content, rewards are received. As a
            content creator, you compete to create the best content for the community&#39;s attention. Earn STAMP coins
            for creating great content; these coins can be exchanged for value or used to purchase other Permaweb
            services.</p>
          <h2 id="stamps-are-open">STAMPS are OPEN</h2>
          <p><img src="https://arweave.net/Ixo8vY7opo5rkuEusKIvXLy2dYyvNeVayvFmUP9G6fo" alt="atomic asset"></p>
          <p>Currently, creators can use <a href="https://pages.arweave.dev">Permapages</a> to create webpages or
            stand-alone blog posts or <a href="https://img.arweave.dev">IMG</a>, but these applications will not be the
            only applications that will participate; other decentralized applications will integrate STAMPs into their
            content publishing systems. This open composability is what separates Permaweb from web2; the community can
            leverage the power of competition to get the best publishing tools for their needs, and content creators
            will be able to change and choose the best tools. Content creators are never &quot;locked in&quot; to a
            specific application.</p>
          <h2 id="how-to-stamp">How to STAMP?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>STAMP pages that you are proud to be associated with. When you stamp a page, you are publicly showing
              preference for that content! There is a timeless record of you stamping your favorite pages!</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>All STAMPs represent an actual human providing love to the content; you might think human verification is
            easy; make sure the user has a wallet, then STAMP, but unfortunately, the world contains bots. In Web2 land,
            you see Captchas, annoying little puzzles, or strangely generated letters that you must input correctly to
            prove you are a human. With STAMPs, we took a different approach; we are leveraging a new service called
            VouchDAO; this organization contains many service members that are voted into the DAO that provide secure
            human verification. You can get verified by using <a href="https://vouch-twitter.arweave.dev">Vouch-Twitter
              Service</a>. Once verified by a vouch service, you are ready to STAMP; no Captcha ever again; you connect
            your wallet to <a href="https://now.arweave.dev">Now</a>, and since a vouch service verifies you, you may
            proceed to STAMP.</p>
          <h2 id="have-fun">Have fun!</h2>
          <p>The Permaweb is a permissionless and trustless platform that empowers the community to build and create
            with zero barriers and 100% control, no walled gardens, backed by decentralized permanent storage. With the
            Permaweb, creators can distribute content in a frictionless flow, which we call the &quot;Web of
            Value.&quot;</p>
          <p>Join us in this new frontier to provide fun and engaging content. Create a funny meme, write a blog post,
            share a photo, STAMP your favorites, sell a percentage of your content, purchase content you appreciate, and
            have fun!</p>
          <p>Go to <a href="https://now.arweave.dev">Now</a> dashboard and start stamping!</p>
