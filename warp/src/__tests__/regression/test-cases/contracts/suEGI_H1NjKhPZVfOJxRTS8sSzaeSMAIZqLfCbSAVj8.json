You can expect a brand new UI launch on Verto.exchange very soon, and we'll then finish updating ArConnect with Ledger support after that. \n\nOur team is going to be releasing some more in-depth material covering this in the near future, so stay tuned!","answerTXID":"su5AuSWPXjU9Z1MEflv7QNrDk73waN7y8uE6_hg7jWQ","answerTo":"IOPewn0msLukJfFf07jmYnk9llGM2M8M4mAMrJD3SR8","atBlockheight":736698,"id":"M15tRayDpw0z3c1IpMmheEw_bxPCV1pWii6R7UguY_Y"},{"answer":"This is a tough question! There are so many incredible people starting incredible projects in the space. Though I can't pick any favorites, I can say with certainty that I am most inspired by the new teams coming into the ecosystem with a goal of collaborating with as many people and protocols as possible. \n\nI don't mean to sound like a broken record, but the composability in this ecosystem is truly unique. Building lego bricks for others to integrate into their own protocols is both attractive from a community/collaboration standpoint and a value proposition standpoint. We as a community have a massive opportunity here.","answerTXID":"qVKFJNZJF7af_sGfF020sXCyIkhig7Sh6uLGEJtdPAA","answerTo":"fITa8X5-HQQstQ5CwTjjD4qc4dmxDw2l-S67wbnNuSs","atBlockheight":736703,"id":"M15tRayDpw0z3c1IpMmheEw_bxPCV1pWii6R7UguY_Y"},{"answer":"Two of the current largest ecosystem pain points (in my opinion) are developer documentation and ease of access to navigating the project/protocols on the permaweb. I believe these are very temporary, but I think all teams could make it a goal to improve their documentation. This especially applies to Verto and ArConnect's JS libraries, so we'll be working on this too! \n\nI somewhat addressed the second part of this question in a previous response, but I am actively encouraging people to find and spend time building lego bricks for others to use in their protocols. Besides that, if you can find a way to align an opportunity in this space with your passion, go for it!","answerTXID":"4AnIHlzS9jfUwFHTLObjOYBlAaLJwdviXqu9IoucjKo","answerTo":"RDsileoSdSmGGpsRyFcHWc_pAFe7HdZ9v5tiZsu7IN4","atBlockheight":736733,"id":"M15tRayDpw0z3c1IpMmheEw_bxPCV1pWii6R7UguY_Y"},{"answer":"At the time of writing this, I am not involved in any DAOs outside of the Arweave ecosystem. My focus lies here! I feel that profit-sharing tokens open the gates for many interesting and novel mechanism designs and use-cases for decentralized technology.
